# Music-app

For this Java project I implemented a music application that contains also a record store in which you can add and buy products from the shop, see details about them, and sort all the products by their price.

The application part is a little more complicated; there you can see media like: songs, playlists, albums, episodes, podcasts and all the categories of these media items. For each item you can see the list, add a new item, delete an item, show particular information of an item and also play an item. For the songs, the "play" method increases the number of streams of both of that song and the artist of the song as well. You can also add a song to a playlist or add an episode to a podcast.

Further on, I will differenciate the methods that belong to the client and the ones that belong to the admin.
